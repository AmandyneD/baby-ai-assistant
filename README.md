# 🍼 Baby AI Assistant

A fun and ultra-simple Python project that simulates a mini AI assistant for CRM (Customer Relationship Management).

This assistant helps you:
- Choose a customer type and engagement level  
- Get the **Next Best Action** (like “send a follow-up email”)  
- Automatically create a short, polite **email draft**  

No setup, no API keys, no advanced libraries — just **pure Python**, made to be understood by anyone, even beginners.
